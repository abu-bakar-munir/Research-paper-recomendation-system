# Research-paper-recomendation-system


This project is designed to classify ArXiv paper abstracts into multiple categories and provide recommendations for similar papers. The classification system uses a multi-label approach, where each abstract can belong to multiple terms or categories. Text data is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization and encoded with multi-hot vectors to handle multiple labels. A shallow neural network (MLP) is trained on the processed data to predict categories, and early stopping is used to improve training efficiency. The trained model can be evaluated on validation and test datasets, and it can also be saved and reloaded for future predictions.

In addition to classification, the project includes a recommendation system that suggests similar papers based on the title. It leverages sentence embeddings generated by a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and computes cosine similarity between embeddings to recommend the top five most relevant papers. Both the classification model and the recommendation system can be saved and reused, making the workflow efficient and practical.

The project uses Python with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Sentence Transformers. It is designed to handle large datasets of scientific abstracts and can be applied to any multi-label text classification and recommendation tasks in research or academic contexts.
